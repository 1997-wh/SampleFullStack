# Full Stack Web Application Portfolio Project

This project is a showcase of a full-stack web application I developed to demonstrate skills in web development, user authentication, and design. The app features a UI and a backend, making it an example of how to create applications.

## Features

### Backend
- **User Authentication**: Includes registration and login with password hashing.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for user data.

### Frontend

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly design for optimal user experience across devices.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Feedback interactions.

## Skills Highlighted

### Programming and Frameworks
- Python (Flask)
- JavaScript (React)
- CSS (TailwindCSS)

### Development Tools
- Database Management with SQLAlchemy
- State Management and Axios for API Calls

### Deployment and Hosting
- Backend hosted on Render
- Frontend deployed on Vercel
